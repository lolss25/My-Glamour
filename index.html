                <h2>Continue</h2>
                <p>You have come so far. You have learned to let go of what was not right for you.  The road has not been easy but it for sure has opened your eyes to all the possibilities life can hold, even in moments of uncertainty.<br><br>
                So...continue to give your all. You are still making the steps toward where you are meant to be. You are still living a life filled meaning.<br><br>
                There will be days when you feel your efforts are in vain and moments when the sudden changes around you feel overwhelming. Yet you are wrapped in endless...boundless grace(wow divinely protected nga pala ikaw) each day to keep going anyway.</p>

                <p>You are sunlight falling through trees. You are laughter that breaks through sadness. You are the breeze on a too-warm day. You are clarity in the midst of confusion.<br><br>
                You are not the whole world, no—but you are everything that makes the world good. Divinely Protected:0</p>

                <p>The truth is, I cannot give you reasons and I cannot answer your questions but what I can tell you is this...each moment that broke you also made you. All those tears you shed cleansed your heart of pain. Each broken piece joined together to create a new you—someone stronger. <br><br>

		So no, I cannot give you a reason why you went through so much pain but I can tell you the purpose. The purpose was always for you to grow, to "develop", to heal, and to become the best version of yourself that in itself should keep you going. <br><br>

               You may not yet be where you want to be but you are somewhere. <br><br>

		Don’t rush to judge where fate leads you, keep moving. You may not reach the destination you envisioned but the path you forge will still take you somewhere extraordinary. Give your best and learn to walk alongside fate, not against it. Befriend it and let it guide you.</p>
